# YAML : YAML Ain't Markup Language
     
       - YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language.
      
       - It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

       - Support for reading and writing YAML is available for many programming languages.
        
       - YAML natively supports three basic data types: scalars (such as strings, integers, and floats), lists, and associative arrays.

       - This is a third party module. so we have to install it manully 

       - this is used to read and write configuration files.





# How to install:
            
                pip install PyYAML






# Basic elements of yaml:


                            - Indentation of whitespace is used to denote structure.

                            - List members are denoted by a leading hyphen (-).

                            - List members are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.

                            - Associative arrays are represented using colon ( : ) in the format of key value pair. They are enclosed in curly braces {}.

                            - Multiple documents with single streams are separated with 3 hyphens (---).

                            - Repeated nodes in each file are initially denoted by an ampersand (&) and by an asterisk (*) mark later.

                            - YAML always requires colons and commas used as list separators followed by space with scalar values.









# YAML vs. JSON:


                    - YAML is a superset of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) but has some built-in advantages. 

                    - For example, YAML can self-reference, support complex datatypes, embed block literals, support comments, and more. Overall, 

                    - YAML tends to be more readable than JSON as well. 
               
                    - YAML: It is a light-weight, human-readable data-representation language.

                    - It is primarily designed to make the format easy to read while including complex features.

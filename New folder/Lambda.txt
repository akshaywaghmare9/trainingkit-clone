#lambda function(anonymous function)



1.Anonymous function:
     
      - A function without having a name is called anonymous function




2. Purpose of anonymous function:

       -Instant use (one time usages)




3. Syntax of lambda function:

       - lambda input_arguments : expression




4. Example:
 
        s=lambda x : x*x
        print(s(4))






#IIFE function:

       -An Immediately-invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a way to execute functions immediately

     
example:
       
        s=(lambda x : x*x) (2)
        print(s)






# Higher order functions:

#Filter function:
          
       - we can use filter function to filter values from the given sequence based on some condition.
       - it returns those elements of sequence,for which function is true.

       -syntax: filter(function,sequence)
      


example:
        list1=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
        print(list(filter(lambda x : x%2==0,list1)))






# map function:

       -for every element present in the given sequence, apply some functionality and generate new element with the required modification.

       -syntax: map(function,sequence)


example:
         list1=[1,2,3,4,5]
         print(list(map(lambda x : x*x,list1)))
        



# reduce function:

        -It redues sequence of element into a single element by applying the some function.
        
        -python 3 does not support direct reduce function so we have to import reduce from functools  
      
        -syntax: reduce(function:sequence)


example: 
         from functools import reduce
         list1=[1,2,3,4]
         print(reduce(lambda x,y : x+y,list1))

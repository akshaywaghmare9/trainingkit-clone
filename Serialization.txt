# Object Serialization:(Marshaling,Pickling)

                - Serialization is the process of converting an object in memory into a stream of bytes
                  like store it on disk or send it over the network.
              
                - In simple word The conversion of python supported form into file supported form is nothing but serialization




       example  -ATM: When the account holder tries to withdraw money from the server through ATM, 
                 the account holder information like withdrawal details will be serialized
                 and sent to the server where the details are deserialized and used to perform operations.








# Object Deserialization:(Unmarshaling,Unpickling)


                - Deserialization is the exact opposite - Fetch a stream of bytes from network or persistence storage 
                  and convert it back to the Object with the same state.
              
                - An object from file supported form into python supported form this reverse process is called as Deserialization.








# pickle module:

                 - If you want save an object to the file and read an object to the file then pickle module concept is we required.

                 







# Object serialization using pickle module:

                  - We can perform serialization and deserialization of an object with respect to file by using pickle module.
                  - It is pythons inbuilt module.
                  - Pikcle module contains dump() function to perform serialization.(Pickling)
        

        syntax :   pickle.dump(object,file)

            



                   - Pickle module contains load() fumction to perform deserialization.(Unpickling)


        Syntax :   object=pickle.load(file)





# Why we need serialization and Deserialization:


                             - When we stored structured data in the file and want to perform some calculations
                               that time we need serialization and deserialization. 









# Json module: 
         
               - As the part of programming it is very common requirement to convert python object into json form
                 and json form into python object,For these conversions(Serialization & Deserialization) python provide inbuilt json module.


              - Json module defines multiple function to seriallization and deserializaton.






              dump():

                    - If you want to serialize python dict object to json (into file object) then we required to go for dump().
           
              load():
                    
                    - If you deserialize file object( json object) to python dict object the we required load() function.




             dumps():

                    - If you want to serialize python dict object to json string then we required to go for dumps(). (i.e Serialize to string)
               

              loads():

                    - If you want to deserialize json strings to python dict object then we required to loads()
